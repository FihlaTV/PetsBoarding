# PetsBoarding 

A mobile application for iOS and Android devices. 

This app helps pets owners find pet resorts/pet sitters based on their expectations(rating,city, price, animal type,etc) in a more convenient way rather than exhausting-search on their websites. 

This project is built on Meteor platform. Running it on mobile emulator will automatically connect to the mLab cloud database. When you are attempting to test it on localhost, the UI will fit if you choose Ripple Emulater mobile device modes on the browser. The localhost won't connect to the remote database and all data is poped up/stored locally.

The future work will keep improving the UI, and apply Google Map API to display locations of filtered results.

A demo video is avaialable on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5crAa-YV7A&feature=youtu.be
